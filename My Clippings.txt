In philosophy, the shift in emphasis from the phenomenal to the psychological was codified by Gilbert Ryle (1949), who argued that all our mental concepts can be analyzed in terms of certain kinds of associated behavior, or in terms of dispositions to behave in certain ways. 7 This view, logical behaviorism, is recognizably the precursor of much of what passes for orthodoxy in contemporary philosophy of psychology.

When we wonder whether somebody is having a color experience, we are not wondering whether they are receiving environmental stimulation and processing it in a certain way. We are wondering whether they are experiencing a color sensation, and this is a distinct question. It is a conceptually coherent possibility that something could be playing the causal role without there being an associated experience.

Sri Ramakrishna had had an enchanting voice, his singing bewitched listeners—but soon he could not sing. That day, Sri Ramakrishna pleaded with the doctor like the child he was: ‘Please cure my illness. I cannot chant the name and glories of God.’ ‘Meditation is enough,’ the doctor observed. ‘What do you mean?’ Sri Ramakrishna exclaimed. ‘Why should I lead a monotonous life? I enjoy my fish in a variety of dishes: curried fish, fried fish, pickled fish, and so forth! Sometimes I worship God with rituals, sometimes I repeat his name, sometimes I meditate on Him, sometimes I sing his name and glories, sometimes I dance in His name . . .’

He talked about God to anyone who came to see him. If someone asked about his health, he would say: ‘Let the body and pain take care of each other. O my mind, you stay in bliss.’ Many times the devotees implored the Master, ‘Sir, if you do not cure yourself, no one can cure you.’ The Master always answered calmly: ‘I see that the body is like a paper doll, and it has a hole in its throat. What shall I do with it?’

Devotion to the body of the master takes us away from his teaching, from living by his teaching. Second, it diverts us from higher goals—the very ones which the master taught us to focus on. And, finally, it makes us even more dependent on him: if we had not been so attached to his body, and through that to representations of his body, his passing away could in fact have compelled us to at last do what he had been urging us to do—that is, to rely on ourselves. If we fail to break our own identification with our body, we will be in for an even worse trauma when our own end comes.

The reason why phenomenal and psychological properties are often run together is clear: it is because the relevant properties tend to co-occur. Generally, when the processes resulting from tissue damage and leading to aversion reaction take place, some sort of phenomenal quality is instantiated. That is, when psychological pain is present, phenomenal pain is usually also present. It is not a conceptual truth that the process should be accompanied Page 18 by the phenomenal quality, but it is a fact about the world. Once we have this sort of co-occurrence of properties in everyday situations, it is natural that our everyday concepts will bind them together.

My initial bewilderment, my perplexity at being totally ignored, slowly fade away as this strange fascination begins to grip me more firmly. But it is not till the second hour of the uncommon scene that I become aware of a silent, resistless change which is taking place within my mind. One by one, the questions which I have prepared in the train with such meticulous accuracy drop away. For it does not now seem to matter whether they are asked or not, and it does not seem to matter whether I solve the problems which have hitherto troubled me.

The real disease Sri Ramana’s answers centred mainly on the proposition that the body itself is the disease, and its dissolution is of little consequence: the Self alone is real, and that is not going to be affected either way by the death of the body. When the body has served its purpose, it should be allowed to go. Indeed, the Jnani is relieved to see it go. ‘The body is like a banana leaf on which all kinds of delicious food have been served,’ he told the distraught devotees. ‘After we have eaten the food from it, do we take the leaf and preserve it? Do we not throw it away now that it has served its purpose?’

As you walk along with him he will be anxiously looking forward to his destination so that he can throw off his burden and get relief. In the same way the Jnani is anxious to throw off his mortal body.’ ‘And then he corrected the explanation,’ Osborne reported. ‘This exposition is all right as far as it goes, but strictly speaking even this is not quite accurate. The Jnani is not even anxious to shed his body; he is indifferent alike to the existence or non-existence of the body, being almost unaware of it.’

17 August 1948: An American devotee asks, ‘Bhagavan what should a devotee do at the time of death?’ Bhagavan: ‘A devotee never dies, rather he is already dead . . . What should a devotee do at the time of death? What can he do? Whatever a man thinks in his life-time, so he does in his last moment—the worldly man thinks of his worldly affairs and the devotee of devotion and spiritual matters. But a Jnani having no thoughts of any kind, remains the same. His thoughts having died long ago, his body also died with them. Therefore for him there is no such thing as death. ‘Again, people fear death because they fear to lose their possessions. When they go to sleep they do not have such a fear at all. Although sleep resembles death in leaving all possessions behind, it causes no fear in their hearts because of the knowledge that the next morning they will enter into their possessions again. The Jnani, having no sense of possession, is entirely free from the fear of death. He remains the same after death as before it.’

A group of sadhus and devotees sat together on the temple ramp just opposite the little room and began singing ‘Arunachala Siva’, the supreme song of Divine Love that Bhagavan has given us. More joined in. The singing swelled louder to drown murmurs and cries of grief. Inside the room, Bhagavan bade them sit him up. The pain must have been intense, but he found it appropriate to die sitting, as our Guru. At the sound of ‘Arunachala Siva’, he opened his luminous untroubled eyes, with a brief smile of indescribable tenderness, and a tear of bliss trickled down from the outer corner of his eyes. And then, at 8.47, breathing stopped. There was no struggle or spasm, no other sign of death: only that the next breath did not come . . .

A scholar of the first water, Vinoba knew several of our languages starting with Sanskrit; he knew English, of course, and also French and German. To read the Quran in the original, he learnt Arabic; and to learn the correct pronunciation of the words, he listened to recitations of the Quran over the radio in jail. His Selected Works—not Collected, just Selected!—cover twenty-one volumes in small-font Devanagari. Among these are several classics. Confined in the Dhule Jail, in 1932 at the request of other inmates, he gives a lecture every week on one chapter of the Gita. In 1944, confined this time in the jail in Seoni, he gives talks on the eighteen verses in which the Gita sets out the ideal of the Sthitaprajna. Were he to read just these two—Talks on the Gita and Sthitaprajna Darshan—the reader will find in them models of lucidity, precision, as well as innovative interpretation.

But you don’t see what else I eat: I eat santosh; I eat one adhyaya of the Gita, eighteen times a day; I walk under the sky and I take calories from it.

‘After remembering the Lord’s name,’ Vinoba said of himself, ‘I go to sleep thinking that I am going into the lap of God. If God says, “You have to come today,” Baba 11 will not say, “Give me two months more, some work is left.” Baba will say, “I am ready to come this very second.” No duty of mine remains. If You want to keep me, I will serve tomorrow. If You want to call me to your lap, I am ready. If I awaken the next morning, I shall work. If not, finished! For this reason I have determined that we should take the evening prayer to be the last one, and after that keep maun; and “die”.’ 12

There is no single route to the end: scriptures like the Gita teach different paths because of the differing temperaments and aptitudes of individuals.

picture Vinoba in solitary confinement in that cell, 8 feet by 9 feet in dimension: how he converts imprisonment into ashram life; how in that tiny space, in forced and complete isolation, he retains his mental discipline by meditating for two to three hours every day; how he disciplines himself physically by walking every day for eight hours inside that suffocating cell, and thereby covering ten miles—covering ten miles in a cell 8 feet by 9 feet every single day!

As we age, our bodies wane. We are able to do less and less with them. As the resources at our disposal dwindle, we are able to pursue fewer and fewer pleasures. One way is to keep doing things at the pace at which and to the extent to which we have been doing them. For a while, this will work—it may even keep us in better shape than we might otherwise be. But a point will come when we will not be able to do the same things to the same extent. That would hit us not as a mere disappointment but as a cruel reminder that we have aged. But supposing, following Gandhiji’s rule, we kept a step ahead of our ageing: supposing we gave up some habit, some pleasure, some assets one step ahead of the compulsions that our ageing will impose on us. Having chosen the restriction ourselves, we would be in for less of a shock.

And these self-imposed restrictions are also devices that enable one to keep control in one’s own hands, and to thereby sidestep the feeling of helplessness—one of the things that frightens us about the last days: as Sri Ramana says ‘No more’ to further surgery; as Vinoba politely declines the entreaties and suggestions of doctors, associates, Mrs Indira Gandhi, that he take at least water—he is in control, he knows to the very last moment of awareness that he is in control.

First, by definition, at that time we will be losing control over our bodies. To ensure equanimity in those final days and hours, the only part of us that could possibly be within our control—if it has not been destroyed by dementia or Alzheimer’s, for instance—is our mind. And, second, that we cannot expect to begin in those final days and hours, and successfully harness the mind for ensuring equanimity. We will be able to do so only if we have made doing so a practice over a lifetime.

But whatever befalls me at His hand, notice that at every step of the way, His existence, the boons He confers, the punishments He decrees confirm me: He creates me; He instils faith in me, or He withholds it from me; He makes me do good or ill; eventually I appear in His court, in which He rewards or punishes me (for what I have done because He made me do it, of course); then I enjoy those unthinkable rewards or I live through those imaginable tortures. And at the end of eons, I merge back into Him for life and bliss everlasting.

Consider worshipping an idol. The original idea was to infuse certain virtues into the idol—the ceremony of praana pratishthaan, of imbedding the soul, still evokes that idea; and, through meditating on the idol, to pour those virtues into ourselves so much so that those virtues become our very nature, and we come to live by them instinctively. But what do we do? We install that idol. We genuflect to it. We recite mantras before it. We make offerings—especially on the day said to be the special day of the deity that idol is said to represent. And then we go about doing exactly what we were going to be doing in any case. When death comes, we go on imploring that idol, and it can do nothing.

Prayers were devised to make us humble—to make us acknowledge that there are forces beyond our little selves, that all we can do is make the best effort that we can, the outcome depends not just on those efforts but also on circumstances far beyond our control.

He must aim at privacy and solitude. He is not to indulge in arguments with those who hold views different from his; in such polemics and debates one aims at winning the argument: the effort diverts one from the inner quest, and the ‘winning’ is liable to boost one’s ego, as ‘losing’ is liable to stir resentment, feelings of inadequacy and other emotions.

As you can see at once, even these directions just about wandering and sleeping hone us in many ways: they bring us pillow-to-pillow with death; they accustom us to transience—in this instance, for example, to meeting persons and leaving them; they accustom us to privations and hardships of various kinds; they get us out of the habit of planning for the future, to say nothing of storing things for the future; they accustom us to uncertainty, to trust in the future, and, when that trust turns out to be misplaced, they teach us to accept the added hardship. Cumulatively, they turn us inward—away from material possessions, worldly honour or shame, and the like. It isn’t just that we turn away from possessions. We soon see that the problem is not the thing that lures us to the shopping mall. The problem is the reaction that the thing ignites in our mind. Once our mind stops reacting to the thing, once it becomes indifferent to the thing, the latter presents no problem: it can keep lying there in the shopping mall. The same goes for praise and blame. For delicious and tasteless food. For a luxurious house and a rough bed.

We are going about our day normally, and suddenly the one temptation that we must resist appears, and we can’t contain ourselves. These are precisely the aversions and attachments that can be best put to work—for like those moments of transitions, the intense outburst at someone, or succumbing to something, snaps the ropes that hold us within bounds. We are in open space. We have to sharpen our mindfulness of both: that flying off the handle, and what it is that has set us to flight.

a man caught in a violent storm takes shelter in the first cave he sees oblivious of the deadly snake that resides there. That is why it is so vital that we learn early on to stabilize the mind. That is why it is vital to learn to be vigilant about every thought and emotion that springs in our life, and to be careful and diligent in everything we do, at every moment that we are awake, and, later, throughout the time we are asleep also. The more we condition our mind to be steady, to be vigilant, to be inclined towards doing good, the greater the chances that, buffeted and knocked around, it will choose the right course at every turn.

As we will see, whether there is a journey after death or not is one of those unknowables. It is a matter that we need not even seek to settle. Again, the Buddha is the guide. He did not get entangled in questions about God, the afterlife and the like. Pressed on such questions, he would say that whether there is God or not, whether there is life after death or not, whether time has a beginning and an end or not, whether space is infinite or finite, there is suffering. It has to be dealt with. There is a way to deal with it. And here is the way.

Frequently, someone putting forward an explanation of consciousness will start by investing the problem with all the gravity of the problem of phenomenal consciousness, but will end by giving an explanation of some aspect of psychological consciousness, such as the ability to introspect.

Consciousness is always accompanied by awareness, but awareness as I have described it need not be accompanied by consciousness.

Cognitive models are well suited to explaining psychological aspects of consciousness. There is no vast metaphysical problem in the idea that a physical system should be able to introspect its internal states, or that it should be able to deal rationally with information from its environment, or that it should be able to focus its attention first in one place and then in the next.

In general, supervenience is a relation between two sets of properties: B-properties—intuitively, the high-level properties—and A-properties, which are the more basic low-level properties.

Was the wife with you when you went out to the office, or in your deep sleep? She was away from you. You were satisfied because of your thought that she was somewhere. Whereas now you think that she is not. The difference lies in the different thoughts. That is the cause of pain. The pain is because of the thought of the wife’s non-being. All this is the mischief of the mind. The fellow (i.e., the mind) creates pain for himself even when there is pleasure.

Mourning is not the index of true love. It betrays love of the object, of its shape only. That is not love. True love is shown by the certainty that the object of love is in the Self and that it can never become non-existent.

God’s will for the prescribed course of events is a good solution of the free-will problem. If the mind is restless on account of a sense of the imperfect and unsatisfactory character of what befalls us or what is committed or omitted by us, then it is wise to drop the sense of responsibility and free will by regarding ourselves as the ordained instruments of the All-wise and All-powerful, to do and suffer as He pleases. He carries all burdens and gives us peace.
